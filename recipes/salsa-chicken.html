This delicious recipe takes literally minutes to prepare and can be tweaked with endless options for toppings to make sure you don't get bored with it.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>48 oz Fresh Medium Salsa</li>
        <li>5 pounds of Chicken Breast</li>
        <li>Optional toppings (choose your own but these are what I used):</li>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Large Onions</li>
            <li>10 oz Spinach</li>
            <li>Guacamole</li>
            <li>Low carb tortilla wraps</li>
        </ul>

    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken in the crock-pot</li>
        <li>Pour your salsa all over the chicken. Use a spoon and mix up the salsa so that it is evenly covering all the chicken in your pot</li>
        <li>Cook, covered, on high for 4 hours. Feel free to Netflix & Chill, do some laundry, or take a nap while you wait!</li>
        <li>While you wait, clean and dice any veggies you wanted to add later. Set them aside in a separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken has cooked, open your pot and use two forks to pull the chicken apart thoroughly. Once shredded, mix the contents of your pot so the salsa and chicken are well distributed.</li>
        <li>Use a large spoon or ladle to scoop out the chicken salsa mixture into bowls or containers</li>
        <li>Take your veggies and add an equal amount to the top of each bowl or container</li>
        <li>Let the food cool before you put them in your freezer or fridge to store for the week ahead</li>
        <li>When youâ€™re ready to eat, add on some spinach, guacamole, or whatever you want to make the bowls extra tasty and unique!</li>
    </ol>
