# odin-recipes
First Odin Project of making a recipe HTML page.

This will be my first mini-project of creating a website outside of my main 'Tom's Programming Dump website. This will test me on adding imnages, lists and using links to other pages.

This project will also test me on when to write commit comments, the best times to commit and to get used to using git.

The website will not be the prettiest, but I will try to endevour to come back to it at a later stage to enhance it as I go on to learn more about coding.

All the best,
Tom
